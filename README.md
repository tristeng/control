# Control Experiments
This repository outlines various control experiments using modern control theory and state space controller design.

## Requirements
Modern version of Python (developed on Python 3.7.1).

It is highly recommended that you create a Python virtual environment before installing the python libraries.

### To run the simulations in a game engine:  
```pip install pymunk pyglet```

### To run the notebooks:  
```pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter```

## Running the Samples

### Simulations
#### Inverted Pendulum
Controlling an inverted pendulum using a moveable cart.

```python invpend.py```

### Notebooks
